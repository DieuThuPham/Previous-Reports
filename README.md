This repository contains a collection of reports developed during my previous internships. To ensure confidentiality, all datasets have been modified and anonymized. Throughout these projects, I independently sourced data from multiple reputable resources, performed data cleaning and preprocessing using Microsoft Excel, and conducted preliminary analyses to extract actionable insights. The results and key findings were then compiled into visually structured slide presentations using Canva, which were delivered to various departments as part of internal reporting and strategic review processes. These reports reflect my ability to manage data workflows, derive insights, and communicate outcomes effectively in a professional setting.
